On this repository we track high profile JS libraries used on our projects.

**This form is our initial approach, we'll see how it fits our needs and adjust if necessary.**

## react-query

v3.39.2 (Qstream)

##### Description

Backend state management solution

##### BUGS

##### Architectural decisions

It's way better for managing Server state than using Redux or other packages for Client state management. 

## @mui/x-data-grid-pro

v5.17.17 (Qstream)

##### Description

Feature rich library for presenting data in tables

We had to pick out-of-the-box solution. Since we already use @mui the DataGrid from @mui was an obvious choice.

##### Architectural decisions
